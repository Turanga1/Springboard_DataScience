# City of Boston Payroll Analysis

An analysis of select payroll spending trends based on the City of Boston earnings reports.

Earnings data is available for City of Boston employees from 2011 to 2017 as annual “CSV” files:

https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report

The entries are classified into the following columns:

'name' = Full name of city employee
'department' = Department name
'title' = Job title
'regular' = Base earnings (salary) as total of pay for a given year
'retro' = Retroactive payments for a given year
'other' = Additional payments categorized as “other”
'overtime' = Overtime pay
'injured'  = Payment issued for qualified employees who are not working due to injuries
'detail’ = Construction detail work
'quinn' = Education incentive specifically for police department
'total' = Numerical sum of prior columns
'zip' = Zip code of employee’s primary residence


The report will focus on the following questions:

1. Is total payroll increasing and what are the reasons for this? This information could be helpful in forecasting budgets and identifying opportunities for cost reduction. Examples of positive factors are cost of living increases, promotions, increase of better paying job titles and increased overtime. Examples of negative factors could be employee attrition, increase of lower paying job titles and reduction in overtime pay

2. How does the job title, department or school impact an employee's pay? Is it possible to classify by these categories?

3. Are there any social trends that Boston residents would care about? For example, which zip codes are home to the highest and lowest average paid employees? Can we identify geographic clusters of certain professions? 

Cost savings recommendations would be useful to Boston taxpayers who are interested in return on investment for their tax dollar. Analysis of the data could identify opportunities for cost savings which could result in lower taxes or a redirection of tax dollars for other purposes.

Any outcomes must be viewed from both a business as well as a political perspective. It will be up to political debate if any cost savings recommendations are implemented. This analysis merely helps inform the debate.
